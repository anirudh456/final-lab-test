* Introduction

There are two types of wires in this application.  Each wire
is used to connect two components. 

Things that flow on wire are always dictionaries.   Each of
the wire datatypes carry a =spec= field that describe the
shape of the dictionary.  

 - [[./instr/index.org][instr]] :: An instruction comes in as input to the Guard.
      The Guard returns the instruction if the instruction
      survives the Guard's scrutiny.  An instruction has a
      command ([[./cmd/index.org][cmd]]), which may be either a =show_user=, or
      =add_user=, or =del_user=.    


 - [[./result/index.org][result]] ::  A result datatype combines the value returned
      by the engine with the input to the guard.
