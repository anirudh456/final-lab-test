* Introduction

Factories are classes or objects that create other classes
or objects.  At present, there is one factory in the
application, which creates property classes (classes with
whose fields are specifiable via type constraints and an
invariant between the fields).

All the object classes (=Email=, =Name=, etc.) are defined
using property class factory.
