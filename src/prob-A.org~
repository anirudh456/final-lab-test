* Group A Problem set

You are given the implementation of the =show_users= route.
Please study the implementation and the test cases to
understand how the route is implemented across the two
components: guard and engine.

Now, your job is to complete the implementation of the guard
and engine components for =add-user= user route.  

Follow these steps:

** Guard

     1. Go to the [[./runtime/components/guard/add_user/index.org][add_user]] directory that contains a command
        handler =AddUser.do=.  

     2. Go to the =Checks= section of the  [[./runtime/components/guard/add_user/index.org][add_user]] page of =Guard=.
        Under each of its subsections, you will find
        incomplete definitions of methods, namely:

		- =check_type=
		- =check_auth=
		- =check_state=

	 3. Complete the definitions of the above methods.


	 4. Build and test.  There are some test cases in the
        [[./runtime/components/guard/add_user/tests][add_user tests]].  Please study them and make sure
        that they continue to PASS!

	 5. Write the test case =test_check_auth=.  Complete the
        [[./runtime/components/guard/add_user/tests/check-admin-auth.org][TestCheckAuth]] test case by providing a definition of
        the =test_check_auth= method.  This test is supposed
        to raise an exception because the session's role is
        not admin.


** Engine

     1. Go to the [[./runtime/components/engine/add_user/index.org][add_user]] directory of the engine that
        contains a skeleton of the command handler =AddUser.do=.


	 2. Complete the =do= method by invoking the appropriate
        method on the entity manager.

     
     3. Make sure test cases continue to PASS!
