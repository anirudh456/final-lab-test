* First things first

 1. Questions are allowed only about the initial build.  

 2. No questions will be entertained after the 10am.  Please
    proceed after making reasonable assumptions after that.

 3. Literate code is under [[./runtime]].  Built code is under
    [[../build/code]] and documentation under [[../build/docs]].

    You are expected to conform strictly to the above
    structure.  If you need to create any new directories,
    please make sure they are in the tree under [[./runtime]].
    If you fail to do so (e.g., create a new directory under
    =src=), you may incur major penalties.


 4. Please sit ONLY at the seat assigned to you by your
    TA's.  


 5. Fill in the org file [[./student-info.org]].  Do this now
    Please clearly mention your seat number.

* What to do next

 1. Locate your exam problem sheet based on whether you are
    in the group A or B


    Your group determines the problem set you will need to
    attempt.

|---------+-------+-------------|
| Seat No | Group | Problem Set |
|         |       |             |
|---------+-------+-------------|
| Even    | A     |             |
|---------+-------+-------------|
| Odd     | B     |             |
|---------+-------+-------------|


 1. Read the high level description of the application at
    [[./app.org]].

 2. Study the literate code implementing the application
    that is a much smaller version of the user directory
    application.  The starting point of the system's
    documentation is the [[./runtime/index.org][runtime]].  Don't spend too much time
    just reading, you can always come back to reading the
    code.  

 3. Reach for your problem sets:

     - Problem set A  [[./prob-A.org]]


     - Problem set B  [[./prob-B.org]]


 4. Incremental builds :: Please read
      [[./p-description.org][Description of how to do incremental builds]]  to speed
      up your build process!



* Good Luck!
